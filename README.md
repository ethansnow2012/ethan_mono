### use "pnpm" by default

There are three way to start this project. Thank you for interested in my works and practices.

1. CLI

```
node ./cli.js
```

2. Start as a normal node monorepo

```
Node.js 18 + pnpm install -> go to project -> pnpm run install
```

3. Makefile to start docker

```
make <xxxxxx(see Makefile)>
```
